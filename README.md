# ** DEPRECATED **
Do not use this plugin, it was an experiment for me to learn Ghidra Sleigh before Ghidra had an official support for RISC-V. I'm not planning to update this anymore.

RISC-V processor plugin for Ghidra

## Introduction
It's a basic language plugin for Ghidra to add support for RISC-V architecture. This is still work in progress.

I will write a proper readme soon, meanwhile have fun :D
